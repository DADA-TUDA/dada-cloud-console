# Lessons

- When the user points at git watcher / gitops-agent sync, verify the repo-local agent in the current workspace first; do not cross over to similarly named infra repos.
- If the request is about project sync in the UI, treat `projects` table bootstrap and `project.yaml` state-repo bootstrap as first-class sync surfaces, not optional extras.
